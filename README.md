# BrainFlix

Brainflix is a full-stack & responsive YouTube clone, and features key components of any online video player: Main Video, Sidebar Video Reel, Comments Section, and an Upload Page with updating POST functionality

It was developed to have a separate front and back end, completed in 3 sprints.  Sprint 1 & 2 can be found in this repository's branches.  Users on mobile, tablet, or desktop devices can seamlessly navigate through videos and their respective comment sections.  Users can also upload a new video which will then be displayed in the Sidebar Video Reel. Photos were used instead of videos as the primary focus of this project was to demonstrate proficiency in state management and establishing read route connections to the backend.

The primary goal for Sprint 3 was to build out and utilize our own API instead of relying on mock data, and this final leg of the project exists as its own repository titled: [arjun-sahjpaul-brainflix-api](https://github.com/ffluxpavillion/arjun-sahjpaul-brainflix-api).

## Tech Stack
React.js, Express.js/Node.js backend, and SCSS for styling.
